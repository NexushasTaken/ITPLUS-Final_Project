                Doom is a first-person shooter game developed and published by
                id Software. Released on December 10, 1993, for DOS, it is the
                first installment in the Doom franchise. The player assumes the
                role of a space marine, later unofficially referred to as
                Doomguy, fighting through hordes of undead humans and invading
                demons. The game begins on the moons of Mars and finishes in
                hell, with the player traversing each level to find its exit or
                defeat its final boss. It is an early example of 3D graphics in
                video games, and has enemies and objects as 2D images, a
                technique sometimes referred to as 2.5D graphics.

                Doom is a first-person shooter presented with 3D graphics.
                While the environment is shown in a 3D perspective, the enemies
                and objects are instead 2D sprites rendered at fixed angles, a
                technique sometimes referred to as 2.5D graphics or
                billboarding.[2] In the single-player campaign mode, the player
                controls an unnamed space marine—later unofficially termed
                "Doomguy"—through military bases on the moons of Mars and in
                hell.

                Doom is divided into three episodes, each containing about nine
                levels: "Knee-Deep in the Dead", "The Shores of Hell", and
                "Inferno". A fourth episode, "Thy Flesh Consumed", was added in
                an expanded version, The Ultimate Doom, released two years
                after Doom. The campaign contains very few plot elements, with
                a minimal story presented mostly through the instruction manual
                and text descriptions between episodes.

                Id Software planned to self-publish Doom for DOS-based
                computers and set up a distribution system leading up to the
                release. Jay Wilbur, who had been hired as CEO and sole member
                of the business team, planned the marketing and distribution of
                Doom. As id would make the most money from copies they sold
                directly to customers—up to 85% of the planned US$40 price—he
                decided to leverage the shareware market as much as possible.
                He believed that the mainstream press was uninterested in the
                game and bought only a single ad in any gaming magazine.
