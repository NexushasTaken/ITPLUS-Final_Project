                Tetris, created in 1985 by Alexey Pajitnov, is a renowned puzzle
                video game where players manipulate differently shaped pieces to
                complete lines on a playing field. These completed lines vanish,
                awarding points, while uncleared lines reaching the top end the
                game. Originally published by various companies, the rights
                eventually returned to Pajitnov, who formed the Tetris Company with
                Henk Rogers. The game's simplicity contributed to its status as one
                of the greatest video games, selling over 202 million copies by
                December 2011 across various platforms. Its influence extends
                beyond gaming, impacting culture, architecture, music, and even
                research on its effect, known as the Tetris effect.

                In Tetris, players manipulate falling tetrominoes, geometric
                shapes that can be moved laterally and rotated as they descend
                into a playfield. The goal is to create complete horizontal
                lines by strategically placing these shapes. Completing lines
                earns points and clearing multiple lines simultaneously grants
                bonuses. As the game progresses, the falling pieces speed up,
                challenging the player's quick decision-making. If the stacked
                pieces reach the top, the game ends. The Tetris Company has
                established guidelines for publishers to follow, specifying
                aspects like button controls, playfield size, and rotation
                system since 1996. The game is about achieving as high a score
                as possible before reaching an inevitable loss.

                The pieces on which the game of Tetris is based around are called
                "tetrominoes". Pajitnov's original version for the Electronika 60
                computer used green brackets to represent the blocks that make up
                tetrominoes.[8] Versions of Tetris on the original Game Boy/Game Boy
                Color and on most dedicated handheld games use black-and-white or
                grayscale graphics, but most popular versions use a separate color
                for each distinct shape. Prior to the Tetris Company's
                standardization in the early 2000s, those colors varied widely from
                implementation to implementation.

              <h1 class="title" id="scoring">Scoring</h1>
              <section>
                The scoring formula for the majority of Tetris products is built on
                the idea that more difficult line clears should be awarded more
                points. For example, a single line clear in Tetris Zone is worth 100
                points, clearing four lines at once (known as a Tetris) is worth 800,
                while each subsequent back-to-back Tetris is worth 1,200.[9] In
                conjunction, players can be awarded combos that exist in certain
                games which reward multiple line clears in quick succession. The
                exact conditions for triggering combos, and the amount of importance
                assigned to them, vary from game to game.[citation needed]

                Nearly all Tetris games allow the player to press a button to
                increase the speed of the current piece's descent or cause the piece
                to drop and lock into place immediately, known as a "soft drop" and a
                "hard drop", respectively. While performing a soft drop, the player
                can also stop the piece's increased speed by releasing the button
                before the piece settles into place. Some games only allow either
                soft drop or hard drop; others have separate buttons for both. Many
                games award a number of points based on the height that the piece
                fell before locking, so using the hard drop generally awards more
                points.

              <section>
                In 1992, John Brzustowski wrote a thesis reflecting on the question
                of whether or not one could theoretically play Tetris forever.[10] He
                reached the conclusion that the game is statistically doomed to end.
                If a player receives a sufficiently large sequence of alternating S
                and Z Tetrominoes, the na√Øve gravity used by the standard game
                eventually forces the player to leave holes on the board. The holes
                will necessarily stack to the top and, ultimately, end the game. If
                the pieces are distributed randomly, this sequence will eventually
                occur. Thus, if a game with, for example, an ideal, uniform,
                uncorrelated random number generator is played long enough, any
                player will almost surely top out.[11][12]

                Modern versions of Tetris released after 2001 use a bag-style
                randomizer that guarantees players will never receive more than four
                S and Z pieces in a row by shuffling tetrominoes of all types for
                each 7 pieces.[13]5:20 This is one of the "Indispensable Rules"
                enforced by the Tetris Guideline that all officially licensed Tetris
                games must follow.[7]

                "Easy spin" or "infinite spin" is a feature in select Tetris
                games allowing tetrominoes to briefly pause after movement or
                rotation, letting players strategize their placement. Initially
                introduced in The Next Tetris in 1999, this feature received
                mixed reviews, criticized for disrupting traditional gameplay
                by reducing speed pressure. Some felt it broke the game, while
                others saw its impact limited to certain modes. Henk Rogers, a
                Tetris Company co-founder, defended it as aiding novice
                players' decision-making without affecting expert competitive
                play. Later games imposed a limit on this feature, with pieces
                automatically locking after a certain number of actions to
                balance gameplay.
