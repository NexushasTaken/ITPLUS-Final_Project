                Galaga[a] is a 1981 fixed shooter arcade video game developed
                and published by Namco. In North America, it was released by
                Midway Manufacturing. It is the sequel to Galaxian (1979),
                Namco's first major video game hit in arcades. Controlling a
                starship, the player is tasked with destroying the Galaga
                forces in each stage while avoiding enemies and projectiles.
                Some enemies can capture a player's ship via a tractor beam,
                which can be rescued to transform the player into a "dual
                fighter" with additional firepower.

                Galaga is a fixed shooter. The player mans a lone starfighter
                at the bottom of the screen, which must prevent the Galaga
                forces from destroying all of mankind.[5] The objective of each
                stage is to defeat all of the Galaga aliens, which will fly
                into formation from the top and sides of the screen.[6] Similar
                to Galaxian, aliens will dive towards the player while shooting
                down projectiles; colliding with either projectiles or aliens
                will result in a life being lost.[6]

                Galaga was created by Japanese developer Shigeru Yokoyama, a
                long-time veteran of Namco.[7] Namco's first big video game hit
                in arcades was Galaxian (1979);[8][9] the game's success led
                Namco to produce a large number of Namco Galaxian arcade boards
                to keep up with demand.[7] By the early 1980s the game was
                becoming harder to sell, so to help clear out inventory,
                Yokoyama was tasked with creating two new games that could run
                on the Namco Galaxian board.

                Sega-Galaga, the first home conversion of Galaga, was published
                by Sega for the SG-1000 in 1983.[14] An MSX version followed a
                year later in 1984.[15] A conversion for the Family Computer
                was released in 1985 for Japan,[16] which was later released
                internationally by Bandai for the Nintendo Entertainment
                System, subtitled Demons of Death in North America.

                Galaga was met with acclaim, with many applauding the addictive
                nature, gameplay structure, innovation and improvements over
                its predecessor, and was a popular game during the golden age
                of arcade video games.
